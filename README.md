In context of job applications and interviews, it is not always clear, what skills and capabilities the candidate (in this case - me)
has and where the main technical competence lies.

During the last years, it became apparent, that a simple list of relevant projects with short desciptions often circumvents and avoids such uncertainties.

With those projects, often linked with the correspondent repositories, I hope to create an impression of my strengths and
capabilities.

Most of my more meaningful projects are uploaded or developed using this GitHub account.

All projects I designed, planned and implemented myself are explicitly published as Open Source for
unrestricted further use.

The list of exercises and projects is not complete and rather serves to create a valid impression of the technical side of myself.
The majority of the listed projects were created in context of my studies (Computer Science - Bachelor and Master).
Several others I build in my private time.
